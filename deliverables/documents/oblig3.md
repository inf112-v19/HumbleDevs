Mandatory exercise 3

Current roles:
  •	Teamlead: Amalie
  •	Costumer contact: Linh
  •	Libgdx (frontend): Joachim and Bendik
  
How do the roles of the team work?
  •	Unclear roles
  •	Customer contact seems unnecessary for this task, due to the fact that everyone need to know just as much about the game. 
  •	Review the code more frequently 

Do you need to update who is teamlead or customer contact?
  •	no

Do you need other roles? 
  •	no, but we need to be more specific about current roles

Revised roles:
  •	Teamlead: Amalie
    o	Meet referating
    o	Project Board
  •	Customer contact: Linh
    o	card class
  •	Libgdx: Joachim and Bendik
    o	Libgdx “pros”, 
  •	Class design: Even
    o	Player
    o	Game class

Write down some points about what the different roles actually mean to you.
  •	The roles means that everyone has their own responsibility to contribute to the progress of the game
  •	Everyone in the group is comfortable with their assigned task

Are there any experiences either team-wise or regarding project methodology that is worth mentioning?
  •	More pair programming

Does the team think the choices you've made are good? If not, what can you do differently to improve the way the team works?
  •	We are satisfied with the choices we have made so far, but we may take more frequently decisions.
							
How are the group dynamics? How does communication work for you?
  •	Slack Notifications are slow, but otherwise we are satisfied with Slack as communication platform.

Make a brief retrospective in which you consider what you have done so far and what can be improved. This is about project structure, not code. You can of course discuss code, but this is not about error correction, but about how to work and communicate.
  •	more clear communication
  •	update project board, smaller tasks, easier to implement
  •	we should also be better to review the code together and explain why and what we have done during the programming.
  •	We should also be more confident in using git (merging master e.g.)
  •	Attacking the problems in subgroups: Programming in subgroups (“pair programming”)

During evaluation, every member's contribution to the code base will be emphasized. If there is a big difference in who commits, you must enclose a brief explanation as to why it is like that. Remember to commit everything. Including design files. Report from meetings since the previous delivery must also be delivered.
From the retrospective agree and write down three things (max), that the team will follow up during the next sprint.
  1.	Code review
  2.	Subdivision of tasks
  3.	Attacking the problems in subgroups: Programming in subgroups (“pair programming”)

Part 2: requirements
							
Clarification of the customer's requirements. What are the actual tasks? How do the team Prioritize these tasks?
  •	Our main priority has been the map so far. We have updated the project board after the requirements, and divided the tasks. 

If changes are made in order from what is given by the customer, why is this done?

How will you verify that the requirements are met? (What are the acceptance criteria?)
  •	By writing tests.

Update what your priorities are, how far you have come and what you have done since last time.
The list of requirements is long, but it is not necessary to deliver on all requirements if it is not realistic. It is more important that the tasks that you've executed are of high quality. Regard subproblem 4: "Completed tasks must be finished."
							
Part 3: Code
							
You need to document how the project builds, tests, and runs such that it's easy to test the code. During evaluation, the code will also be user tested.
Document how the tests should be run, as well.
  •	TBA
  
Code quality and test coverage are emphasized. Note that the tests you write must be used in the product.
							
Completed tasks must be finished.
Deliver class diagrams. (If there are many classes, make class diagrams for the most important ones.)
