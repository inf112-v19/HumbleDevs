Mandatory exercise 3

Part 1: Project and project structure
- How do the roles of the team work? Do you need to update who is teamlead or customer contact? Do you need other roles? Write down some points about what the different roles actually mean to you.

- Are there any experiences either team-wise or regarding project methodology that is worth mentioning? Does the team think the choices you've made are good? If not, what can you do differently to improve the way the team works?

- How are the group dynamics?

- How does communication work for you?

- Make a brief retrospective in which you consider what you have done so far and what can be improved. This is about project structure, not code. You can of course discuss code, but this is not about error correction, but about how to work and communicate.

- During evaluation, every member's contribution to the code base will be emphasized. If there is a big difference in who commits, you must enclose a brief explanation as to why it is like that. Remember to commit everything. Including design files.

- Report from meetings since the previous delivery must also be delivered.

- From the retrospective agree and write down three things (max), that the team will follow up during the next sprint.

Part 2: requirements
- Clarification of the customer's requirements. What are the actual tasks?

- How do the team Prioritize these tasks?

- If changes are made in order from what is given by the customer, why is this done?

- How will you verify that the requirements are met? (What are the acceptance criteria?)

- Update what your priorities are, how far you have come and what you have done since last time.

- The list of requirements is long, but it is not necessary to deliver on all requirements if it is not realistic. It is more important that the tasks that you've executed are of high quality. Regard subproblem 4: "Completed tasks must be finished."
